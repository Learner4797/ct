		<p><h2>The origin of cricket is unknown. Most probably, its name was derived from the Old English cryce, which means “stick,” and, in its rude form, resembled the 13th century game known as club-ball.
		Cricket evolved in England in the 18th century, mainly because of the interest of great landowners who tried their skills on a field of play with their tenants and the local peasantry.</h2></p><br>

		<p><h2>A circular cricket field is considered as the perfect field but generally a cricket pitch is slightly oval. Its diameter varies between 137m and 150m. The ICC Test Match Standard Playing Conditions (October 2014) Law 19.1 defines the playing area as a minimum of 137.16m from boundary to boundary square of the pitch, with the shorter of the two square boundaries a minimum of 59.43m. The straight boundary at both ends of the pitch is a minimum of 64m. Distances are measured from the centre of the pitch.
		Boundaries are not to exceed 82.29m from the centre of the pitch.</h2></p><br>

		<p><h2>The bat has a willow striking face, which must not be more than 38 inches long, and a cane handle layered with thin strips of rubber bound with twine or steel spring and covered with a sheath of rubber.
			The bat may not be wider than 41/4 inches and usually weighs between 4 and 6 ounces over 2 pounds.
			The ball has a hand-stitched red leather cover and an interior of cork wound with twine. It weighs between 51/2 and 53/4 ounces and measures 9 inches in circumference.
		A cricketer’s uniform is white: shirt, trousers, boots, and sweater. Batsmen and the wicketkeeper also wear gloves and pads to protect their hands and legs and a helmet with a mesh face guard. The umpires wear long white coats over normal clothing.</h2></p><br>

		<p><h2><strong>Cricket is a game played between two teams made up of eleven players each. There is also a reserve player called a “twelfth man” who is used should a player be injured during play.</strong></h2></p><br>
		<p><h2><strong>The twelfth man is not allowed to bowl, bat, wicket keep or captain the team. His sole duty is to act as a substitute fielder.
		The original player is free to return to the game as soon as they have recovered from their injury.</strong></h2></p><br>
		<p><h2><strong>To apply the law and make sure the cricket rules are upheld throughout the game there are two umpires in place during games. Umpires are responsible for making decisions and notifying the scorers of these decisions.</strong></h2></p><br>
		<p><h2><strong>Two umpires are in place on the playing field while there is also a third umpire off the field who is in charge of video decisions.</strong></h2></p><br>
		<p><h2><strong>This is where the call is too close for the on field umpires and they refer it to the third umpire who reviews slow motion video replays to make a decision.</strong></h2></p><br>

		<p><h2>The 2019 Cricket World Cup Final was a One Day International cricket match played at Lord's in London, England, on 14 July 2019 to determine the winner of the 2019 Cricket World Cup. It was contested by the runners-up from the previous tournament, New Zealand, and the host nation, England. It was the fifth time Lord's hosted the Cricket World Cup Final, the most of any ground.
			The two teams were tied on 241 runs at the end of the match, resulting in a Super Over being played to break the tie. On the final ball of New Zealand's Super Over, after equalling the 15 runs England managed in their over, Martin Guptill attempted to score the winning run but was run out by wicket-keeper Jos Buttler, meaning the Super Over was also tied. England won on the boundary count back rule, having scored 26 boundaries to New Zealand's 17, thus becoming Cricket World Cup winners for the first time.
		It was the first time a One Day International final match required a Super Over, and subsequently the first time it had been decided by a boundary count. The match has been described as one of the greatest and most dramatic in the history of the sport, with some analysts describing it as the greatest match in the history of one-day cricket.</h2></p><br>

		<h2 class="abc" style="color:#fa3600";>About INDIAN team:-</h2><br><br><br><br><br><br>
		<img src="india.jfif" alt="INDIAN TEAM">
		<p><h2>The India men's national cricket team, also known as Team India and Men in Blue, is governed by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), and is a Full Member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) with Test, One-Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) status.

		Cricket was introduced to India by European merchant sailors in the 18th century, and the first cricket club was established in 1792. India's national cricket team did not play its first Test match until 25 June 1932 at Lord's, becoming the sixth team to be granted test cricket status. From 1932 India had to wait until 1952, almost 20 years for its first Test victory. In its first fifty years of international cricket, India was one of the weaker teams, winning only 35 of the first 196 Test matches it played. The team, however, gained strength in the 1970s with the emergence of players such as batsmen Gavaskar, Viswanath, Kapil Dev, and the Indian spin quartet.

		Traditionally much stronger at home than abroad, the Indian team has improved its overseas form, especially in limited-overs cricket, since the start of the 21st century, winning Test matches in Australia, England and South Africa. It has won the Cricket World Cup twice – in 1983 under the captaincy of Kapil Dev and in 2011 under the captaincy of Mahendra Singh Dhoni. After winning the 2011 World Cup, India became only the third team after West Indies and Australia to have won the World Cup more than once, and the first cricket team to win the World Cup at home. It also won the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 and 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, under the captaincy of MS Dhoni. It was also the joint champions of 2002 ICC Champions Trophy, along with Sri Lanka.

		The Indian cricket team has rivalries with other Test-playing nations, most notably with Pakistan, the political arch-rival of India. However, in recent times, rivalries with nations like Australia, South Africa and England have also gained prominence.

		As of 1 May 2020, India is ranked third in Tests, second in ODIs and third in T20Is by the ICC. Virat Kohli is the current captain of the team across all formats, while the head coach is Ravi Shastri.</h2></p><br>
